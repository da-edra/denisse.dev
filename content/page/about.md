I'm a  Site Reliability Engineer from Mexico who loves to contribute to free open source software.

I'm part of the Arch Linux security team, I maintain some AUR packages and I lead the Arch Linux Mexico community.

I have two amazing dogs I rescued from the streets, their names are Shiva and Cobol.
